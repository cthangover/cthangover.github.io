# Level 1 — Player: Patching a Character

You'll buff the character Marao — increase health, attack, and add the "Stun" ability — using the patch system. Zero code, just JSON.

---

## Step 1: Create the mod folder

Every mod lives in its own folder inside `mods/`. Create:

```filestree
mods/
└── my_tweak/
```

---

## Step 2: manifest.json

Every mod needs a manifest. Create `mods/my_tweak/manifest.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "my_tweak",                 // Unique mod identifier, use English
  "name": "Marao Buff",             // Display name shown in the mod management menu
  "description": "My first mod!",   // Description visible in the mod list and catalog
  "author": "player"                // Mod author (arbitrary string)
}
```

A minimal manifest only needs `name`, but it's better to fill in `id` as well. The kernel auto-discovers the folder and loads it as a mod.

---

## Step 3: Character patch

Create `mods/my_tweak/patches/characters.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "Items": [
    {
      "Id": "Marao", // Character ID to patch (defined in the core mod)

      "Health": 5000, // New property values — overwrite the originals
      "Attack": 1200,
      "Points": 2,

      "Actions$add": ["physics/stun"] // $add appends elements to an array
    }
  ]
}
```

### How it works

- **`"Id": "Marao"`** — the patch target: character with identifier `Marao` (defined in the `core` mod).
- **`"Health": 5000`**, **`"Attack": 1200`**, **`"Points": 2`** — overwrite the character's fields. New values replace old ones.
- **`"Actions$add": ["physics/stun"]`** — the `$add` suffix means "append to the array". The action `physics/stun` is added to the list. The default `physics/attack` and `physics/defence` remain.

## Step 4: Run and check

Start the game. Enter any battle — Marao now has:

- **5000 HP** instead of 10
- **1200 ATK** instead of 5
- A third action **"Stun"** alongside "Attack" and "Defence"
