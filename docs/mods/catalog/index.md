# Mod Catalog & Network Repository

The mod catalog system lets players browse and install mods from online
repositories. A catalog is a JSON file hosted on a web server; the game
fetches it, merges entries from multiple URLs, and compares them against
locally-installed mods.

## Catalog JSON Schema

```jsonc
{
  "catalog": {                                             // Catalog metadata envelope
    "version": 1,                                          // Schema version of this catalog file
    "updated_at": "2026-10-23T07:10:38Z"                   // ISO-8601 timestamp of last server update
  },
  "mods": [                                                // List of mod entries in this catalog
    {
      "id": "live2d_base",                                 // Canonical mod identifier (matches manifest.json id)

### Root envelope

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `catalog.version` | int | Schema version of this catalog file |
| `catalog.updated_at` | string | ISO-8601 timestamp of last server update |
| `mods` | array | List of mod entries |
| `collections` | array | Games and toolsets in the same envelope; see [Collections](../collections/) |
| `catalog.links_expire_at` | string | Optional private keyserver link-expiry metadata; archive access is granted by the issued URLs |

### Per-mod entry

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Canonical mod identifier (must match the mod's `manifest.json` `id`) |
| `name` | string | Fallback display name (used when no `locale` entry matches the player's language) |
| `author` | string | Author credit |
| `version` | string | Semver version of the latest release (e.g. "1.0.0") |
| `description` | string | Fallback short description (used when no `locale` entry matches the player's language) |
| `locale` | object[] | Localized name/description entries for different languages (see below) |
| `category` | string | Category slug or comma-separated combination of slugs (e.g. `"library, gameplay"`): `story`, `characters`, `gameplay`, `visual`, `audio`, `ui`, `locale`, `library`, `engine`, `overhaul`, `tools`, `editor`, `debug`, `other` |
| `tags` | string[] | Search/filter tags |
| `icon_url` | string | Full URL to preview icon (PNG or JPEG) |
| `depends` | string[] | Versioned dependency strings (e.g. `"cthangover_game>=1"`) |
| `conflicts_with` | string[] | Mutually exclusive mod IDs |
| `downloads` | object[] | Version-specific download entries with mirrors |
| `downloads[].version` | string | Semver version of this download entry |
| `downloads[].urls` | string[] | Mirror URLs for the .zip archive (tried in order) |
| `downloads[].size_bytes` | long | File size of the zip (for progress display) |
| `downloads[].archive_sha256` | string | SHA256 of the .zip file itself (integrity check after download) |
| `downloads[].install_sha256` | string | SHA256 of the extracted mod content (modification detection) |
| `downloads[].changelog` | string | Optional changelog describing what changed in this specific version |
| `status` | string | `stable`, `beta`, `deprecated`, or `archived` |
| `min_game_version` | string | Minimum compatible game version (semver) |
| `max_game_version` | string | Maximum game version, or null |
| `source_urls` | string[] | Written during merge with source provenance; public sources can be cached on disk, private sources stay in memory |
| `variant_conflict` | bool | *Written by the game*: set when two catalogs publish the same id/version/title with different content hashes — the entries are kept separate instead of merged so the UI can warn about a likely modified build |

### `locale[]` sub-fields

Each entry in the `locale` array has three fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `lang` | string | Language code (ISO 639-1, e.g. `"en"`, `"ru"`) |
| `name` | string | Localized display name |
| `description` | string | Localized short description |

Resolution order: exact language match → fallback to `"en"` → first entry in the array → top-level `name`/`description`.

## Checksums

Two SHA256 hashes are stored per download entry (per version):

**`archive_sha256`** hash of the .zip archive as it sits on the server.
The game verifies this after downloading to detect transfer corruption.

**`install_sha256`** hash of the mod's extracted content, computed by:
1. Enumerating all files in the mod (recursively)
2. Excluding dot-prefixed files/directories (`.godot/`, `.import/`,
   `.gitignore`) and patterns from `catalog_ignore_patterns` in
   `mod_config.json`
3. Sorting files by path (case-insensitive)
4. For each file: `SHA256(path_bytes + content_bytes)`
5. Final: `SHA256(file_hash_1 + file_hash_2 + ...)`

When the game detects that a locally-installed mod's `install_sha256`
differs from the catalog value, it shows a "Modified locally" warning.
Overwriting such a mod from the network would lose the player's changes.

## Configuration

Catalog URLs are configured in `config/mod_config.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "catalog_urls": [                                        // URLs to fetch catalog.json from (merged in order)
    "https://example.com/mods/catalog.json",
    "https://mirror.example.com/mods/catalog.json"
  ],
  "catalog_ignore_patterns": [".*", "bin", "obj"]          // Glob patterns to exclude from install_sha256 computation
}
```

The **code default** for `catalog_ignore_patterns` is `[".*"]` (`ModConfig.CatalogIgnorePatterns`), which excludes all dot-prefixed entries. The `config/mod_config.json` shipped with the game extends this to `[".*", "bin", "obj"]` to also skip build output directories.

Multiple URLs are merged — when the same mod appears in two catalogs,
the entry with the highest `version` wins for metadata (name, description,
category, etc.), while `downloads` arrays from all sources are merged:
same-version entries have their `urls` lists combined (deduplicated).

The game caches public catalog entries and collections to `user://catalog_cache.json`. In **Mods & Collections**, **Refresh catalog** re-fetches enabled sources. Private responses and temporary download URLs stay in memory; they are excluded before public-source cache merging.

Architecture note: the catalog system provides the *data source* for an HTTP catalog scanner. For details on how a custom scanner turns catalog JSON into `DiscoveredModEntry` items that the kernel can load, see [Resources — Scanners](../../resources/scanners/).

## Player-managed catalog servers

**Catalogs (N)** in the Mods & Collections header opens the source list. Add/edit the name, server address, enabled switch and optional access key; save applies the list and refreshes immediately. A bare origin such as `127.0.0.1:18080` becomes `http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1/catalog`; non-loopback bare hosts default to HTTPS. Full catalog paths are kept. URLs cannot include user credentials, a query or a fragment.

Before the first edit, the list is seeded from `catalog_urls` and `catalog_token_files` in `config/mod_config.json`. Afterwards `user://catalog_servers.json` is authoritative, even if empty. Its entries have `id` (32 hexadecimal GUID characters), `name`, `url`, `enabled`, `token_file`. Disabled sources remain saved but are not fetched. Source filters in the mods gallery combine with search, category and status filters; **Local only** selects entries without a catalog source.

Private sources use a separate bearer file, not a token embedded in a URL or public manifest. Keys must be exactly 1024 Base64URL characters after trimming. The endpoint must be HTTPS or literal loopback HTTP. Requests send `Authorization: Bearer …` to the exact catalog URL with redirects disabled. The archive downloader does not copy that header to download URLs.

The manager stores new keys as plain-text files in `user://catalog_keys/`; the source list contains paths only. A blank key on an unchanged URL keeps the old key. Changing the URL requires explicit key entry; **Remove saved key** makes it public. Removing/replacing a source deletes only key files owned by this store, leaving externally supplied token files intact. Writes publish the key before the source list atomically.

Before installation, when private sources are configured, the downloader refreshes the catalog and selects the current source/version entry. A successful empty response replaces old permissions. Private entries are never persisted to the catalog cache; a total failed refresh with private sources configured clears the in-memory access snapshot. Partial success publishes the successful sources and reports errors for the others.

Implementation: `Core/Mods/CatalogServerStore.cs`, `Core/Mods/CatalogRequest.cs`, `Core/Mods/CatalogService.cs`, `Core/Mods/ModDownloader.cs` and `mods/mod_manager/src/`.

## Exporting a mod to the catalog

From the mods menu, select a locally-installed mod and click
**Export to Catalog**. This opens a dialog where you fill in the
download URL, category, tags, and changelog, then generates:

- A `.zip` archive of the mod (if it was a folder)
- A `.json` catalog entry file alongside the archive

Categories are pre-checked from the mod's `manifest.json` `category`
field (falling back to `other` when absent); several categories can be
toggled at once.

Both files go into the mods root directory. The JSON snippet can be
copied to clipboard and pasted into the catalog JSON you host online.

Ignore patterns for the SHA256 computation can be customized in
`mod_config.json` via `catalog_ignore_patterns`. The code default `[".*"]`
excludes all dot-prefixed entries; the shipped `config/mod_config.json`
adds `"bin"` and `"obj"`.

## Publishing all mods and the game: `sync_mods`

`sync_mods.bat` / `sync_mods.sh` (`sync_mods.py`) in the repository root is the one script for a release. It
builds every mod (below), reads both hosts (git.cthangover.ru and github.com, owner and token from the `origin`
and `github` remotes), prints every difference — missing `mod_<id>` repositories, unpushed commits, missing or
differing release archives, release texts, catalog entries, the game's packages — asks once and then fixes
them: creates repositories (GitHub allows about 8 at a time, so it creates them in batches and waits half an
hour between them), pushes fast-forward only, keeps one release per version (an existing one gets its archive
and text replaced, copies are removed, a later version on a host is never overwritten), and pushes the
catalog to both `cthangover/catalog` repositories. The game's packages from `build_release` go to the release
`v<config/version>` of `cthangover/cthangover`. Running it again is safe; the rules are in the script's header.

### Building only

`build_mod_releases.py` (used by `sync_mods`, also runnable alone) does the same as **Export to Catalog** for every folder mod at once and writes to `releases/`:

- `mod_<id>-v<version>.zip` — the mod's content files at the archive root, hidden entries (`.git/`, …) left out;
  entries are sorted and dated 1980-01-01, so an unchanged mod rebuilds with the same `archive_sha256`;
- `mod_<id>-v<version>.json` — its catalog entry;
- `catalog.json` — the whole catalog; every download lists both mirrors (the Gitea release, then the GitHub
  release; the game tries them in order), so the same file goes into both catalog repositories. The icon is
  the Gitea raw `mod.jpg`.

Entries come from `manifest.json` (name, author, version, description, category, depends, conflicts_with) and
the mod's `mod_<id>_name` / `mod_<id>_desc` keys in every language; tags are the id's words plus the categories;
`install_sha256` uses `catalog_ignore_patterns` from `config/mod_config.json`. Options: `--only=a,b`,
`--skip=a,b`, `--hosts=gitea,github` (mirrors and their order), `--out=<dir>`.

## Mod status display

The unified Mods view combines installed and remote state, including disabled and older-version choices. The remote comparison uses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Installed** | Same version, same content hash |
| **Update available** | Newer version in catalog |
| **Not installed** | No local copy found |
| **Modified locally** | Same version, but `install_sha256` differs player edited the mod |
